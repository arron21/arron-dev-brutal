<h2>Just looking at some of these numbers makes my country, the USA, look pretty bad</h2>

<h3>Some numbers...</h3>
<p>Japan has 2,299 deaths.</p>
<p>France, 55,521 deaths.</p>
<p>Germany, 9,434 deaths.</p>
<p>USA, <strong>281,253</strong> deaths.</p>

<p>My heart goes out to every family that has been broken, and to everyone who died alone.</p>
<p>I pray that next time the world is challenged by an event like this, that we are a more compassionate and solution driven people. Maybe then there would not be so many people affected by this.</p>

<p>I am including the screenshot below.</p>
